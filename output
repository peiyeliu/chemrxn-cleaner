Purged this stirred mixture by bubbling nitrogen through for an hour, then added the Palladium acetate. Heated to 130\u00baC in a metal block (block at 150\u00baC) and held at this temperature for 3 hours. LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.82 minutes, 84%. Allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness at 50\u00baC giving __ a dirty-yellow solid residue.  Treated with 150 ml water and the resulting yellow solid filtered off and washed with water. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum over phosphorous pentoxide at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 11.98 g pale- yellow solid [A].  LCMS(monitorbase) showed it to be DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 90%.  _ _ This material was crystallised from acetonitrile; dissolved up in ~1 litre boiling acetonitrile and the cloudy solution filtered hot through a fluted paper. Crystallisation of product from the filtrate was eventually achieved, with difficulty, by rapid cooling in drikold/acetone and seeding/scratching as it warmed up. Cooled in ice/water then the solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 6.03 g creamy-white solid [B].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.49 minutes, 96%.  Material B was combined with the same product from P14-A and this total of 7.32 g recrystallised from the minimum of acetonitrile (~550 ml) with hot filtration again to remove trace insoluble matter. Cooled in ice/water and seeded/scratched to induce crystallisation then stood in the fridge overnight. The solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum initially at room temperature, then at 60\u00b0C, to constant weight. This afforded 5.04 g creamy-white solid [C].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 371.06 and MH- = 369.08 at 1.85 minutes, 99%.  Unfortunately nmr showed entrapped acetonitrile at an unacceptable level (~0.5 equiv.). To remove this material C was stirred in ~100 ml ether for an hour, recollected and washed with ether. Dried at 60\u00b0C as before to constant weight. This afforded 4.73 g creamy-white solid [D].  "

Purged this stirred mixture by bubbling nitrogen through for an hour, then added the Palladium acetate. Heated to 130\u00baC in a metal block (block at 150\u00baC) and held at this temperature for 3 hours. LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 83%. Allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness at 50\u00baC giving a light-green solid residue.  Attempted to partition this residue between DCM (~50 ml) and saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (~50 ml). The insoluble matter was filtered off and washed through with water, then DCM. This dirty-yellow solid was dried by desiccation overnight. Wt = 2.04 g. LCMS showed it to be DP, 94%.  This material was crystallised from acetonitrile; dissolved up in ~150 ml boiling acetonitrile and the cloudy solution treated with a little Norit SX4 decolourising carbon. Filtered hot through a fluted paper. Slow crystallisation of a creamy-white solid occurred on cooling to room temperature. Cooled in ice/water then the bulky solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum at room temperature overnight. This afforded 1.29 g creamy-white bulky solid [A].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 99%.  "

The reaction was heated to 150 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in the microwave reactor and cooled to RT. LC/MS showed completion.  The reaction mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc , and washed sequentially with water and saturated brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude oil was triturated with EtOAc, Et2O and hexane to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give P1 N-(4-(5-chlorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ylamino)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide (680mg, 38%)as a tan solid.

The tube was then charged with nitrogen and dioxane (0.589 mL) was added. The tube was then evacuated again and placed under a nitrogen balloon for 8 hours. LC/MS confirmed formation of the product (m+1 = 418) at t= 2.07 min. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo leaing a brown solid (472 mg). This material was the redissolved in EtOAc, filtered through Celite, washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. Concentration in vacuo gave a rust solid (272 mg). This material was purified by ISCO (0-10% MeOH/DCM). Concentration of the fractions in vacuo gave an orange oil. This material was then repurifed by ISCO (4-8% MeOH/DCM) and (0-4% MeOH/DCM). Both gradients resulted in impure material, so the recovered orange oil was purified again by ISCO (60-100% EtOAc/Hex). Concentration in vacuo gave a yellow solid (34.8 mg). LC/MS showed this material to still be only 80% pure, so it was purified again by ISCO (55-95% EtOAc/Hex). A yellow solid (25.4 mg) was again collected.

The flask was evacuated and backfilled with N2 (3x), and then anhydrous dioxane (40 mL) was added. The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for ~5 minutes and was then heated under N2 in a 100 \u00b0C oil bath.  After heating overnight, LC-MS showed complete conversion of the starting material to the desired product (trace N-phenylated product). A significant side product appeared to be present, derived from the starting aminoquinazoline that had undergone two Suzuki couplings in the previous step (see EN01547-76; MW=518.6). The reaction was allowed to cool and was partitioned between EtOAc and H2O. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organics were concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography (Rf in EtOAc = 0.44) to give a yellow-orange solid.  2.92 g (51%) of solid was collected. A trace of EtOAc remained by NMR analysis despite being kept under high vacuum over the weekend.  "

The reaction was worked up with water (50 mL) and diluted with EtOAc (400 mL), and washed sequentially with water (100 mL) and saturated brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography (330g column), elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in DCM (rising quickly to 20% then more slowly to 50%). The impure fractions were collected and combined and purified again in exactly the same way. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford isopropyl 4-(5-methyl-6-(2-methyl-6-(methylsulfonyl)pyridin-3-ylamino)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate, EN02029-72-solid-1, as a yellow solid. This solid was recrystallised from MeOH (~ 50 mL) and the resultant solid filtered off and washed with cold MeOH (2 x 5 mL), Et2O (2 x 5 mL) then isohexane (2 x 5 mL). The solid, EN02029-72-solid-2 was combined with the product from EN02029-67-01 and the whole sample was named EN02029-72-01 (8.39 g) and submitted to the collection.  "

The analysis on crude 4-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate shows traces of non cyclized and non aromoatized by-products.  2010-03-02  15:25:22: To a 25 mL roundbottomed flask was added ethyl 4-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate (LR; 1 g; 3.72 mmol) and toluene (7 mL/g-bulk- LR; 7 mL). The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. To the mixture was added toluene (7 mL/g-bulk-LR; 7 mL) and the mixture was concentrated a second time under reduced pressure. To the mixture was added toluene (7 mL/g-bulk-LR; 7 mL) followed by 1-benzylpiperazine (1.3 eq; 0.852 g; 0.84 mL), BINAP (0.04 eq; 93 mg) and TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (0.02 eq; 68 mg). The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes followed by addition of POTASSIUM TERT-BUTOXIDE (1.4 eq; 0.58 g). The mixture is stirred at Tm=50 \u00b0C.  15:45:57: IPC1 (15 min) sample was gathered. The sample was quenched with a mixture consisting of 700 mM acetic acid buffer pH=2 and methanol. The sample was filtered and analyzed by means of HPLC-UV (EN03690-30-001-F) which indicated 44 % conversion  17:09:21: IPC2 (100 min) sample was gathered. The sample was quenched with a mixture consisting of 700 mM acetic acid buffer pH=2 and methanol. The sample was filtered and analyzed by means of HPLC-UV (EN03690-30-001-H) which indicated 95 % conversion.  17:20:00: The temperature was allowed to reach rt and the mixture was stirred over night.  2010-03-03  09:51:29: IPC3 (18 h) sample was gathered. The sample was quenched with a mixture consisting of 700 mM acetic acid buffer pH=2 and methanol. The sample was filtered and analyzed by means of HPLC-UV (EN03690-30-001-J) which indicated +99 % conversion.  10:10:32: The mixture was transfered to a mixture consisting of 700 mM acetate buffer pH=2 (12.5 mL/g-bulk-LR; 12.5 mL) and isopropyl acetate (6.2 mL/g-bulk- LR; 6.2 mL) to give pH=5.65. To the mixture was added 4 M aqueous sulfuric acid (1.77 mL/g-bulk-LR; 1.77 mL) to give pH=2. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The phases were separated and analyzed by means of HPLC-UV  12:32:57: To the water phase was added dichloromethane (10 mL/g-bulk-LR; 10 mL). The mixture was stirred and 50 % aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 mL) was added to give pH=12. The phases were separated and analyzed by means of HPLC- UV. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to give yellow oil. The crude product was purified by means of column chromatography (40 g SiO2; 4 % MeOH, 1 NH3 in MeOH in DCM; Rf=0.2). Yellow solid was obtained (250 mg). 1H NMR showed not correct product.  **Result:** Correct product was not isolated.  "

The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 3% methanolic ammmonia  (7 M) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford P1 as a brown solid. The product was further purified by crystallisation from hot DCM/MeOH to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (34.0 mg, 15.20 %) as a beige solid.  Conclusion: A relatively low yield of the desired product was isolated here, it may be possible to increase the above yield at higher temperature or by using excess amine as electron rich oxazoles are prone to decomposition.

Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (652 mg, 2.00 mmol) and 4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (112 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 \u00b0C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (34.0 mg, 15.20 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Conclusion: The dimethyl substituted 2-aminooxazole (relatively electron rich) produces more coupled product than the unsubstituted 2-aminooxazole. Of the 2-aminooxazoles tested thus far the 4- and 5-ester substituted aminooxazoles are the most efficient coupling partners.  Note: A run at T= 160 \u00b0C may be beneficial, an increase in yield was seen for the ester substituted 2-aminooxazole under these more forcing conditions.  "

Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (652 mg, 2.00 mmol) and 4-methyloxazol-2-amine (98 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 \u00b0C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.  Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica gel. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-methyloxazol-2-amine (59.0 mg, 28.1 %) as a cream solid.  Note: a further 34 mg of impure product came off the column early and so the yield for this reaction is probably closer to 35% had the purification been efficient.  Conclusion: Somewhat surprisingly the methyl substituted amino-oxazole gave significant amounts of coupled product. It appears that certain moderately elctron rich substrates may also undergo relatively efficient coupling.  "

Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)oxazol-2-amine (46.0 mg, 17.45 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Regioisomeric assignment confirmed by NOESY experiment (see sample P1 analytical data for details).  "

To an oven-dried microwave vial was added ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (546 mg, 3.50 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (0.378 mL, 3.50 mmol), cesium carbonate (2279 mg, 6.99 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (80 mg, 0.09 mmol) and (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (152 mg, 0.26 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. dioxane (18 mL) (degassed) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 160 \u00b0C for 1 h under microwave irradiation.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture shows the required product to be the major product together with an isomer of the same mass (Rt= 1.91), the ratio of the desired product to this isomeric product being circa 5:1. LCMS also shows that a small amount of the 2-aminooxazole ester starting material remains (Rt= 0.99 min) and so the reaction with this particular substrate may benefit from slightly longer reaction times, maybe 90 mins. A small amount of the coupled and decarboxylated product was also present (Rt= 1.68 min).  Saturated ammonium chloride (15 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was transfrred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (80 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL portions). (Note: During this extraction, a solid, presumably the required product was seen to crash out in the organic layer. If this reaction is to be repeated a work-up free approach is recommended where the crude reaction mixture is dry-loaded directly onto silica for chromatographic purification). The solvent was removed from the combined organics under reduced pressure. The crude product was loaded onto a pre- wetted silica column using the minimum DCM and methanol.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 744 mg of impure product.  The crude residue was triturated with Et2O to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (415 mg, 44.3 %) as a beige solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in moderate yield and high purity (95% based on strength NMR). The moderate yield may be improved under a longer reaction time, it is also probable that purification difficulties were also detrimental to the yield of this reaction.  "

Dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 \u00b0C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.    An isolated yield was obtained for reaction (a). Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (111 mg, 41.5 %) as a white solid.  Taking into account that the crude LCMS for reaction (A) corresponds to a ~ 42% isolated yield, the amount of product can be calculated for reactions (B) and (C) using the ratio between the t-Butyl biphenyl and the required product in the LCMS. The amount of required product produced in reaction (B) was 41% and for reaction (C) 45% product was produced.  Conclusion: The above compounds do not poison the catalyst.  Note: Significant amounts of what is assumed to be the regioisomeric 4-aminated product were also formed in these reactions. Major regioisomer formed in ~ 4:1 ratio.  "

Crude LCMS shows a switch in regioselectivity, with the other isomer becoming the major product in 25% yield based on internal standard (note: this is a rough estimate as the U.V absorbance may be significantly different to the other regioisomer). The regioisomeric ratio is 1.7:1 and although the product was not formed in synthetically useful yields, it is an interesting result.  Conclusion: Switch in regioselectivty with the change in ligand may be worth pursuing, although greater selectivity was seen for this prduct in the preceeding reaction.  "

The solution was stirred at 50\u00b0C for 40 mins, then 90\u00b0C for 15 mins (activated catalyst solution; Soln. 1).

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product was present (Rt= 1.70) along with a trace amount of the double addition product i.e. amine addition at the 2- and 4-position (Rt= 1.22 min).  The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride (8 mL) and transferred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (15 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 15 mL portions). The combined organics were then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. DCM (1 mL) was then added to the resulting residue (which still contained anisole (4 mL)) and this solution was loaded directly onto a silica column (40 g).  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM, then 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (59.0 mg, 49.6 %) as an off-white solid. Note: This product was only 52% pure based on NMR strength.

Degassed dioxane (4mL) was then added and the reaction mixture was heated to 160 \u00b0C for 6 h under microwave irradiation.  Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica gel. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, none of the desired product was isolated, although only a trace of required product was observed in the LCMS of the crude reaction mixture.  Conclusion: It appears that under this higher catalyst loading the reaction is less efficent, potentially a concentration effect?  "

Note: the reaction mixture was degassed by first combing the reagents (with the exception of Pd((OAc)2), sealing the vessel and carrying out three pump- purge cycles (vac-nitrogen). Dioxane was then added to this mixture via syringe, followed by the Pd(OAc)2 in a single portion and the vessel was heated for the required time as above. Solvent boiled dry from reaction overnight. Only DMSO remained. **Crude proton NMR shows mainly dichlorpyridine starting material and the 2-aminooxazole starting material was absent**. Crude LCMS indicates that a product of the required mass is present.  The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on C-18 modified silica, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water with basic modifier (1% ammonium hydroxide).

The product isolated, although impure, looks like the required product based on LCMS. The 1H NMR of the purified material is in D6-DMSO here and so not directly comparable with previous spectra in CDCl3.  Conclusion: This may be worth pursuing (i.e. adding DMSO to aid solubility) based on the slightly increased yield.  **Revision: Required product not isolated, spectral analysis of isolated sample does not match those of authentic samples of the coupled product**  .

The crude product was purified by reverse-phase flash chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-4-carboxylate (99 mg, 37.0 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Conclusion: Yield produced under microwave conditions is essentially identical to overnight reaction with conventional heating. Therefore screening of other aminooxazoles can be carried out under microwave conditions in the interest of time.  .  "

The atmosphere was exchanged to nitrogen through consecutive vacuum- nitrogen purge cycles after which the mixture was heated at 120 \u00b0C for 16 h. Still some starting material left according to HPLC and LCMS (IPC 1), so another 25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 116 mg of BINAP was added, and heating continued. After another 4 h, no further progress was detected (IPC 2), so the mixture was allowed to cool to r.t.  Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 2M HCl (aq) (80 mL was added, but made too acidic). The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 70 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since the aq phase still contained some product, another portion of 1M NaOH (aq) (20 mL) was added and the aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The combined organic layers were evaporated and toluene was added to co-evaporate water. The resulting brown solid was dried under vacuum o.n, yielding EN04391-37-001 (12 g, 27.1 mmol, 117 %).  To the solid was added EtOAc (55 mL) and the slurry was stirred at r.t for 1 h. Stirring was turned off and the solid was allowed to sediment for 2 h. The solid was filtered off and washed with 2x 12 mL cold EtOAc, yielding EN04391-37-002 (5.7 g, 12.88 mmol, 55.7 %).  The mother liquor still contained product so it was concentrated and to the residue was added isopropanol (18 mL, 2 mL/ g crude). The mixture was heated to dissolve everything (50 \u00b0C for 5 min) and was then stirred at r.t over night. A white precipitate had formed. The mixture was cooled on an ice bath (0-5 \u00b0C) for 1 h after which the solid was filtered off, washed with 2x10 mL cold isopropanol and dried at 40 \u00b0C under vacuum, yielding EN04391-37-003 (2.3 g, 5.20 mmol, 22.49 %).  EN04391-37-002 and EN04391-37-003 were combined with EN04391-36-002 and EN04391-36-003 and further purified, see page EN04391-38.  "

The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 200 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since an oily residue containing product had precipitated upon addition of acid/ base, the aq phase together with 100 mL dichloromethane was added to the residue in an attempt to dissolve it. More 1M NaOH (aq) was added to assure basic pH and the layers were separated. The combined organic layers were evaporated and the residue was dried under vacuum o.n. EN04391-36-001 (12.2 g, 27.6 mmol, 109 %) was obtained as a brown solid.  To the solid was added isopropanol (48 mL, 4 mL/g crude prod) and the thick suspension was heated at 95 \u00b0C. After 30 min, the slurry was allowed to cool to r.t and left stirring over night. The still thick slurry was cooled on an ice bath at 0-5 \u00b0C for 1 h before it was filtered. The solid was washed with 4x15 mL of cold isopropanol and dried at 40 \u00b0C under vacuum o.n, yielding EN04391-36-002 (2.05 g, 4.63 mmol, 18.38 %) as a pale yellow solid  The mother liquor that still contained product was concentrated. An orange- brown foam was obtained. Toluene was added and evaporated and the residue (8 g) was dissolved in MeCN (13.5 mL) and purified by chromatography (200 g SiO2 in a filter funnel, elutent: EtOAc (750 mL) followed by MeCN (1 L) and MeCN:MeOH 9:1 (1 L)). Fractions 10-13 were combined, concentrated and dried, yielding EN04391-36-003 (5.5 g, 12.43 mmol, 49.3 %) as a solid. EN04391-36-002 and EN04391-36-003 were further purified on page EN04391-38.  "

The reaction mixture was further heated at 80 \u00b0C for 16h and 40 h, see attached 1H-NMR for reaction progress. A comparison with 4773-51 shows that using dioxane or iodide gives a lower yield (slower reaction). Switching the solvent to toluene was explored in 4773-52.

The mixture was evacuated and purged with nitrogen, and warmed to 50\u00b0C.  In a separate vessel, 1-bromo-3-iodobenzene (240 mg, 0.85 mmol), (tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methanamine (98 mg, 0.85 mmol) and sodium-t-butoxide (122 mg, 1.27 mmol) were suspended in toluene (3.5 mL). The resulting mixture was evacuated, purged with nitrogen and warmed to 50\u00b0C.  After ~30 mins, the catalyst mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel. The reaction was evacuated and purged with nitrogen and heated at 80\u00b0C overnight.  This reaction was combined with EN06953-06 for purification.  The mixture was filtered and purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 40% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 3-bromo-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methyl)aniline (71.0 mg, 31.0 %) as a colourless oil which crystallised on standing.  The main impurity was isolated (EN06953-09-02) but this was not identified; assume it is BINAP or the catalyst- ligand complex.  "

The mixture was evacuated and purged with nitrogen, and warmed to 50\u00b0C.  In a separate vessel, 1-bromo-4-methoxybenzene (1 g, 5.35 mmol), (tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methanamine (0.654 mL, 5.35 mmol) and sodium-t- butoxide (0.771 g, 8.02 mmol) were suspended in toluene (7 mL). The resulting mixture was evacuated, purged with nitrogen and warmed to 50\u00b0C. After ~30 mins, the catalyst mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel. The reaction was evacuated and purged with nitrogen and heated at 80\u00b0C overnight. The mixture was diluted with water (250 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL). The organic was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 7M NH3/MeOH and crude fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 4-methoxy-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methyl)aniline (0.270 g, 22.82 %) as a brown oil.

In an attempt to degas the reaction by employing vacuum to the flask good reflux, indicating a slight exotherm, took place. HPLC after 5 minutes indicated complet reaction. The mixture was allowed to cool.  2016-03-02  09:00; Water (50 ml) was followowed by 0.5 M citric acid (~75 ml) to give pH 3. The aqueous phase was extracted with another 25 ml toluene and the combined extracts were washed with water. Removal of the solvent in vacuo followed by evaporation of the solvent gave a reddish brown residue, 13.3 g.  The mixture was dissolved in toluene and purified on a 100 g silica column, 25-100% ethyl acetate over 6 columns, collecting at 300 nm. This flash was repeated on a 340 g silica column to give 6.24 g oil with a clear orange color.  About 4 g more impure material was also isolated. It was realized that preparative HPLC was required for purifiaction of the material. The impurity was mainly the diphosphine oxide originating from the BINAP.  All material was purifed by preparative HPLC, 15-65% ACN in TFA 0.1%. The eluents were neutralized with ammonia and the acetonitrile was removed in vacuo. Extraction with DCM, drying (magnesium sulfate) and removal of the solvent in vacuo (over the weekend) gave 8.21 g semicrystalline material.  The 1H-NMR and 13C NMR looks slightly dubious (too many protons and a13C shift at 3.8 ppm) but probably good enough for further synthesis.  "

To an oven dried microwave vial was added 2-chloropyridine (0.095 mL, 1 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (0.187 g, 2.00 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.207 g, 1.50 mmol) and 4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl (0.027 g, 0.1 mmol). The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen. To this was added the activated catalyst solution (Solution 1) . The reaction mixture was then heated to 90 \u00b0C for 16 h under an inert atmosphere.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture under basic conditions showed a peak which had the mass of the desired product, however, the chloropyridine starting material co-elutes under these conditions. Under acidic conditions none of the desired product mass was observed at Rt= 0.25 min (whereas for EN05378-80 and EN05378-81, the product mass was observed at this retention time). A product of mass corresponding to homo-coupled product was observed under basic conditions. Reaction not progressed.  Conclusion: The 't-Butyl Beller ligand' was not efficent for the coupling of these substrates under the above conditions.  "

To an oven dried microwave vial was added 2-chloropyridine (0.095 mL, 1 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (0.187 g, 2.00 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.207 g, 1.50 mmol) and 4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl (0.027 g, 0.1 mmol). The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen. To this was added the activated catalyst solution (Solution 1). The reaction mixture was then heated to 90 \u00b0C for 16 h under an inert atmosphere.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture (Base) showed the mass peak for the desired product, however, this peak co-elutes with the Cl-pyridine starting material. LCMS of the crude reaction mixture using an acidic method showed no peak in the UV which had a mass corresponding to that of the product, however, the desired mass was observed in the MS at Rt= 0.27 min. A peak in the UV of a mass corresponding to the homocoupled bipyridine product was observed under both acidic and basic methods.  Dichloromethane was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. 2-aminooxazole (103 mg) was recovered. The fraction containing the mass of the desired product produced 33 mg of impure material (see attached proton NMR, the desired product **_may_** be present (but it's hard to say). If this sample was to be pure it would correspond to an isolated yield of ~ 20% of the desired product, due to the fact that this is a really impure sample the real value is probably less than 10%.  Conclusion: Reaction not progressed.      "

The septum and gas inlet was quickly replaced with a microwave vial cap and the mixture was heated at 150 degrees under microwave irradiation for 1h. Two reactions combined and filtered through celite. The filtrate concentrated and submitted for purification (report attached).  **Received a 3 different set up fractions:**  First set up fractions (EN02868-04-1), LC-MS looks clean but 1H NMR shows acetate peak, couldn't getrid of it even longer time on lyohillizer.  Second setup fractions combined, lyophllized, purified by ISCO column (0 - 20% MeOH-CH2Cl2 \\+ 0.05% TEA). The obtained compound is a gum. It was triturated with 2 ml of EtOAc, formed a nice solid, it was filtered, washed with Et2O and dried to give 230 mg of white solid. 1H NMR showed slight shift of couple of peaks, it may be due to the protonation. 63 mg of this compound registered and submitted (EN02868-04-2).  Third setup fractions showed no required product peaks, was discarded.

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product had been formed with very small amounts of side products apparent.  DCM (20 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g) and the solvent was removed from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was then placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 5% methanolic ammonia in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford the desired product in 74% yield and 92% purity by LCMS. The product was triturated with MeCN to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (185 mg, 61.5 %) as a cream solid. This material was shown to be > 95% pure based on proton NMR strength.  Conclusion: The desired product was formed in moderate yield and high purity.  "

The reaction mixture was stirred at 105\u00b0C in an oil bath 12h. The solution was diluted with EtOAc and washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution, brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The aqueous phase was evaporated and the residue was extracted with EtOAc (3X20mL), concentrated. The combined crude material was loaded on a 80g silica gel column and purified on a Teledyne Isco instrument, eluting with 0% to 25% ethyl acetate in heptane to provide tert-butyl 4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (2.164 g, 46.1 %) as a solid.
